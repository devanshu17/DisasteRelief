## Problem Description
The number of disasters has doubled globally since the 1980s, with the damage and losses estimated at an average US$100 billion a year. A lot of progress has been made in using technology for pre-disaster management process (like natural disaster prediction etc) but post-disaster relief is something where equal attention has to be given. One can be prepared for a disaster but cannot prevent it, thus lives can be saved but all natural disaster still bring loss to property, agriculture etc (basic commodities humans need). The challenges to disaster relief organizations, including nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), are immense and mostly they are unsuccessful delivering on its goals due to a lack of coordination among NGOs, which results in duplication of services. Statistics show, out 60% of the items that arrive at a disaster site are nonpriority items, making the flood of donated inappropriate materials in response to a disaster as the second disaster.

Thus I propose a disaster relief and fund management platform, where NGOs and other individuals can collaborate to make donations and other services needed by the disaster victims. 

1) The platform will provide the details of all the items/services needed at relief camps, which will be visible to all the NGOs.
2) NGOs/individuals willing to donate can register for a particular disaster where there will be able given donation limits for relief supplies, thus making sure the delivery of minimum needed supplies at each demand point for the victims but not exceeding the maximum amounts. This strategy will avoid wasteful duplications and congestion in terms of logistics and also ensure the financial sustainability of NGO. 
3) Using Generalized Nash-Equilibrium solution will not only eliminate the possibility of having under- or over-supply, it will guarantee – through competition – the efficient allocation of resources once the minimum requirements are met.
4) This method will improve coordination among organizations thus speeding up the disaster relief process. 
5) As disaster relief organizations compete for financial funds, the platform will also provide a quality index, calculated over parameters like size, amount of donation made etc, to rank NGOs, which can be used to provide unbiased funding to the deserving NGOs. 

With the following approach, problems like, delivery of wrong supplies which adds to the congestion at transportation and also overwhelms storage capabilities will be removed thus smoothing the disaster relief process.
